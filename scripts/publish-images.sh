Usage: scripts/publish-images.sh

Build Dockerfile (cu130) and Dockerfile.cu124 for linux/amd64 and push to GHCR.

Login first. The password is a PAT, not your GitHub password
(classic write:packages, or fine-grained Packages read and write):

  echo "$GHCR_TOKEN" | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin

Environment:
  COMFYFLEET_GHCR_OWNER   default recognizeyourprivilege (lowercased)
  COMFYFLEET_REGISTRY     default ghcr.io
  COMFYFLEET_SOURCE_URL   default https://github.com/RecognizeYourPrivilege/ComfyFleet-Images

Tags:
  ghcr.io/<owner>/comfyfleet-images:cu130
  ghcr.io/<owner>/comfyfleet-images:<git sha>-cu130
  ghcr.io/<owner>/comfyfleet-images:cu124
  ghcr.io/<owner>/comfyfleet-images:<git sha>-cu124

Prints digests after the push.
GHCR rejects a layer over 10 GB and an upload that takes longer than about 10 minutes.
Re-running the script reuses layers that already uploaded.
