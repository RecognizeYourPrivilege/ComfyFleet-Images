# ComfyFleet cu130 instance line. Primary tag: ghcr.io/recognizeyourprivilege/comfyfleet-images:cu130.
# Peer line: Dockerfile.cu124 (ghcr.io/recognizeyourprivilege/comfyfleet-images:cu124).
# Official CPython 3.14.7 on Debian bookworm-slim, plus the NVIDIA CUDA 13.0
# runtime libraries (not the devel toolkit). Bookworm's python3 is 3.11 and
# is not installed. /opt/venv is created from this interpreter. The build
# fails unless sys.version_info[:3] is (3, 14, 7).
#
# gcc is the host C compiler Triton 3.7.1 (torch 2.13.0+cu130) needs to
# JIT-compile cuda_utils. That compile runs when the top-level kitchen
# package loads the Triton backend. Python.h comes from this image
# (/usr/local/include/python3.14). Debian python3-dev is CPython 3.11 and
# is not installed. g++ and the CUDA compiler are not installed.
# libc6-dev sits next to gcc. apt uses --no-install-recommends, which
# skips gcc's recommended libc-dev, so bookworm-slim has no crti.o.
# The llama import smoke links a temporary libcuda.so.1 with gcc -shared
# and fails with "cannot find crti.o" without that package. Triton's
# cuda_utils link needs the same objects. The cu124 line already has
# them: python3-dev installs zlib1g-dev, and zlib1g-dev depends on
# libc6-dev. python3-dev itself only recommends libc6-dev.
#
# No workflow JSON is copied into this image. The operator file is bind-mounted
# at /opt/comfyfleet/instance/default_workflow.json and the entrypoint refuses
# to start when that file is missing.
#
# Pins are recorded in docker/PINS.txt.
# llama-cpp-python==0.3.36 is baked from the abetlen cu130 index (binary
# wheel only) so JoyCaption does not source-build it. The cu124 index is
# not used in this file.
#
# RES4LYF imports cv2 while the custom node loads. The opencv-python wheel
# (not the headless build; that is the name in RES4LYF requirements.txt)
# ships a Qt xcb plugin linked to libxcb.so.1. bookworm-slim does not ship
# that library, which is the "cannot open shared object file" crash.
# libxcb1, libx11-6, libxext6, libice6, libsm6, libglib2.0-0, and libgl1
# cover that plugin plus the libGL and libglib imports cv2 itself performs.
# numpy==2.3.2 is written into torch-constraints.txt next to the torch pins.
# 2.2.6 has no cp314 manylinux wheel; 2.3.2 is the first release that does.
# torchaudio==2.11.0+cu130 is installed with torch and torchvision. There is
# no torchaudio 2.13 on the cu130 index. Pinned ComfyUI-Manager logs
# "PyTorch is not installed" when pip list is missing any of the three; it
# does not import torch. See docker/PINS.txt.

# ComfyUI keeps its .git. Pinned Manager 14b5aaab reads that repo at startup
# (iter_commits for the revision count, plus the commit hash and date). The
# notice route prints "Your ComfyUI isn't git repo." when that date is still
# the 1900 default. A depth-1 ComfyUI repo would report revision 1, so this
# clone stays full and its .git is not removed. Baked custom nodes are
# fetch --depth 1 of the pinned commit, and .git is deleted in this same RUN.
# Manager's own version string is a constant in manager_core.py. It does not
# need its .git to import, and a git pull of that tree would drop the
# trusted-install patch applied later. git stays installed so Manager can
# clone other nodes onto the host custom_nodes mount.
# Pixaroma's workflow-browser examples stay inside that custom node; the
# entrypoint never uses them as the instance default.

# override that with the pure-Python wheel, and it does not rewrite
# annotations: torch 2.13 accepts PEP 585 list[...] custom-op schemas.
